Introduction

  An operating system for x86 and x86_64 platforms. This is a personal
  project written from scratch, and pull requests are not preferred at
  the moment. Collaboration may be possible in the future.

  If you like to discuss operating systems or contact me about other
  topics, my email address is below. Feedback on this OS is welcome.

Build Instructions (Unix/Linux)

  1. Install the following packages (this may require root privileges)

       gcc, g++, make, git, bzip2

  2. Use a proper current directory

  3. Run the following commands (normal user privileges)

     git clone https://github.com/Tiihala/Dancy.git
     cd Dancy
     make

     If cleaning the source tree with "make clean", the external tools
     are not deleted. The "make distclean" will delete these if needed.


Build Instructions (Windows)

  If you are uncertain about these steps, I highly recommend setting up a
  virtual Linux computer and follow the "Build Instructions (Unix/Linux)"
  guide. Installing new software is always a risk (stability, security)!

  1. Install Visual Studio Community
  2. Install Git
  3. Install Nasm
  4. Install Clang
  5. Open "Developer Command Prompt for VS"

     The PATH environment variable must include "git.exe", "nasm.exe" and
     "clang.exe". This can be done without system-wide changes, e.g.

       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Installation\Path\To\GIT\cmd
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Installation\Path\To\NASM
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Installation\Path\To\LLVM\bin

     I recommend setting up a customized "Command Prompt for Dancy". The
     above lines must not be copy-pasted. The path names must be checked.

  6. Use a proper current directory

  7. Run the following commands

     git.exe clone https://github.com/Tiihala/Dancy.git
     cd Dancy
     nmake
