Dancy Operating System
Copyright (c) 2018-2024 Antti Tiihala


Introduction

  An operating system for x86 and x86_64 platforms.


Build Instructions (Unix/Linux)

  1. Install the following packages (this may require root privileges)

       gcc, g++, make, git, bzip2

     Optionally, also the following packages

       binutils-mingw-w64, gcc-mingw-w64, nasm

     If the above three packages are not installed, the Makefile will
     build them (scripts/external.sh). This step itself does not require
     root privileges because all files are put in "./external" directory.

  2. Use a proper current directory

  3. Run the following commands (normal user privileges)

     git clone https://github.com/tiihala/dancy.git
     cd dancy
     make

     If cleaning the source tree with "make clean", the external tools
     are not deleted. The "make distclean" will delete these if needed.


Build Instructions (Windows)

  If you are uncertain about these steps, I highly recommend setting up a
  virtual Linux computer and follow the "Build Instructions (Unix/Linux)"
  guide. Installing new software is always a risk (stability, security)!

  1. Install Visual Studio Community
  2. Install Git
  3. Install Nasm
  4. Install Clang
  5. Open "Developer Command Prompt for VS"

     The PATH environment variable must include "git.exe", "nasm.exe" and
     "clang.exe". This can be done without system-wide changes, e.g.

       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Installation\Path\To\GIT\cmd
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Installation\Path\To\NASM
       set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Installation\Path\To\LLVM\bin

     I recommend setting up a customized "Command Prompt for Dancy". The
     above lines must not be copy-pasted. The path names must be checked.

  6. Use a proper current directory

  7. Run the following commands

     git.exe clone https://github.com/tiihala/dancy.git
     cd dancy
     nmake


Disk Images

  ./release/dancy.iso
  ./release/fdd1440.img
  ./release/usbtiny.img


Build with ACPICA

  The "make" or "nmake" commands need the following options

    make ACPICA_O32_AT=./o32/acpica.at ACPICA_O64_AT=./o64/acpica.at
